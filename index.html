<p align="center"><b>This is an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.</b></p>
<p>We can define artificial intelligence as: The study and the carry out of techniques which need intelligence on the part of a human. We can also define it as the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines for example, computer systems.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence was first created in 1950 by <b>John McCarthy</b> and in the same year <b>Alan Turing</b> started to talk about this reality on an article entitled <b>"Computing Machinery and Intelligence".</b>
<p>It works through algorithms that act from programming rules and its subset Machine Learning (ML) and the different ML techniques such as Deep Learning (DL).</p>
<h3><b>There are two branches of AI :</b></h3>
<p>1. Machine Learning (ML).</p> <p>2. Deep Learning (DL).</p>
