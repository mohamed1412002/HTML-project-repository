There are four types of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which are loading up the new reality.
<h3> Types of Artificial Intelligence (AI): </h3>
<p><b>1. Reactive machines:</b> These (AI) systems do not have memory an only have specific tasks. Deep blue the IBM program that could beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s is an example for it.
<p><b>2. Limited memory:</b> These (AI) systems have memories, so they can use their past experiences in the future decision. This system can be found as an example in some of decision-making functions in self-driving cars. 
<p><b>3. Self-awareness:</b> In this AI systems, AI system have a sense of self which gives them consciousness. This type of AI does not exist yet. 
<p><b>4. Theory of mind:</b> This theory is a psychology term when it is applied to AI,  it means that the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior.
